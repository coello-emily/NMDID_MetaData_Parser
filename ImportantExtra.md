# NMDID Metadata Parser

## Extra Information

Our goal is to not only have a functionin gcode, but a well documented one as well. For this we are going to have some key gadgets we will need to learn to better our code as a whole. 
The following will be links and their relevance to our code.

**Docstring**

Docstring is short for "documentatioon string" and it is a string literal used to document a Python module, class, function, or method. Unlike regular comments, which are ignored by 
the Python interpreter, docstrings are retained at runtime and can be accessed programmatically, for instance, through the help() function or the __doc__ attribute of an object. 

Here is how a docstring should look in our code: ("""Docstring content""" or '''Docstring content'''), they noticiably have three quotations (the secondary version is for multiline
documentation)

Docstrings provide a high-level explanation of what the code does, its parameters, return values, potential exceptions, and any other relevant information for understanding and using
the code.

Finally, here is are two links that can provide guidance on docstrings and their purposes
  - https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/

_More important info and functions will be added with time_
